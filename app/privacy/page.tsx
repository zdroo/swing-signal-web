              <strong>Account data</strong> — your email address and a securely hashed password
              (we can never see the password itself). If you sign in with Google, we receive your
              email address from Google; we never see your Google password.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Usage data</strong> — which assets you look up on SwingSignal, so we can show
              &quot;most searched&quot; lists and decide what to build next.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Anonymous analytics</strong> — page views and feature usage via a
              privacy-friendly, cookie-free analytics tool. No advertising trackers, no
              fingerprinting, no cross-site tracking.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Waitlist</strong> — if you join the Pro waitlist, we store the email you
              provide, used only to notify you about the Pro launch.

            <li>We do not sell or share your data with advertisers or data brokers.</li>

            Why we may process it (legal bases)
          </h2>
          <p>
            We process account and usage data to provide the service you signed up for
            (performance of a contract), analytics and product-demand data in our legitimate
            interest of improving the product, and the Pro waitlist on the basis of your consent —
            which you can withdraw at any time by asking to be removed.

            Service providers &amp; international transfers
          </h2>
          <p>
            We use a small number of processors to run the service: a transactional email provider
            (Resend) to send confirmation and password-reset emails, and hosting infrastructure for
            the application and database. These providers process data only on our instructions.
            Some providers are based in the United States; where personal data leaves the EEA, the
            transfer is covered by the provider&apos;s Standard Contractual Clauses or an adequacy
            decision.

            <li>
              Under the GDPR you can request access to, correction of, deletion of, or a portable
              copy of your personal data, and you can object to processing based on legitimate
              interest. Deleting your account removes your email and personal data from our
              systems.
